To run the crawler:
scrapy crawl venom -o items.json

Venom will crawl all item's pages and collect their names and Ankama ID.
To run, uncomment the category you need, and update the amount of pages the Ankama website has for that category.

Venom-part2 needs to be run after Venom. It will use the file generated from venom and crawl each individual item, collecting its stats. Before running, you need to update lines 28 and 36 with the new file generated by Venom (if you know the IDs of the items you want added, you can skip venom, and just manually add the IDs in the list in line 115).

Set_bonus will crawl through all the sets and colect the items/bonus for each set. Check that the range ofIds in line 22 contains all sets that need updating.

Rosetta needs the whole site to be running. It collects the names of items in all other languages (the other scrapers do only English).

Class_items will collect class items, the ID's of the items need to be input by hand.
